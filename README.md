# mars-rover
This is a project to control a rover on mars (IronHack`s prework)

The purpose of this project is to control a rover at a distance.

The move() function takes an object`s name and a list of commands as arguments. You can move your rover forward (f) or backwards (b), and make it turn left (l) or right (r).

You have a grid of 10x10 to set a limit on the space the rovers can move, but also to add obstacles or other rovers.

You also can use a teleport() function to make your rover instantly change position.
